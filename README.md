# GDSC-BACKEND-Task

Currently created a login and signup page with user authentication.
Signups can be made with unique username only and Logins can be done with correct username and password.

Next, I would like to integrate it to a social media platform clone with functionalities
like:

ðŸ‘‰ Accessing self account 

ðŸ‘‰ Uploading any post on that account

ðŸ‘‰ modifing any post on that account

I would also like to learn how to create peer-to-peer connection for messaging within the application.
